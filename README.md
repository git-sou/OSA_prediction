# OSA_prediction

The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to enhance the detection of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The first part of this kind of project is to learn about the problem and to gain specific knowledge. This improves both the machine learning modeling process and team communication with members from other fields.
